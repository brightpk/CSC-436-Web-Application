## Road blocks and challenges

The homework 1 is completed. Click on clean and count words button would remove all special characters as well as numbers (Ex. ShuttleCloud 999987 -> ShuttleCloud). This button also prints out the number of remaining characters next to the company name and displays the table of how many time each characters appear on company names (All letters including lowercase and uppercase but not whitespace).

The challenge would be when clicking on toggle button, company names were changed from vertical to horizontal but not reverse names. However, the problem is solved and both are flipping (vertical to horizontal / horizontal to vertical) everytime clicking on toggle button.
