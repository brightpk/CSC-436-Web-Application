## Road blocks and challenges

The homework 2 is completed. The challenge would be that I had to spend sometime to debug the code on displaying the text. The program seemed to assign all previous messages in the array to the new text. However, the problem is solved and it displays all the messages in array (including a new message).

## Instructions

1. Download the code 
2. Open terminal 
3. type -> cd <path to myDist project>
4. type -> npm start or ng serve  
5. Click the like button and it will turn green and display 'Image is liked == true' next to the button 
6. Like again, it will toggle to the default button color and display 'Image is liked == false'   
7. Type some message inside the input field on the bottom of the page
8. Click "send" and it will display your message below the image and the like button
