## Road blocks and challenges

The homework 5 is completed. The most challenge thing was how to get AuthGurad and irebase authentication work. It didn't seem to work first but it was because no users are in firebase authentication.
Did one extra credit: logout button when you are on chatpage

## Instructions

1. Download the code 
2. Open terminal 
3. type -> cd <path to angular2-rxjs-chat project>
4. type -> npm install or ng serve -o
5. Login page will pop up and fill up username and password 
6. If username or password is wrong, it will stay on the same page ("localhost:4200/chatpage" will not render unless you're logged in)
7. Once you're logged in, it will bring you to chatpage 
8. Logout button is on the topleft (If you close the tap and come back to chatpage, it still logs you in)
9. The icon message is closed by default. Open it back by clicking on icon or the bar on the bottom right.
